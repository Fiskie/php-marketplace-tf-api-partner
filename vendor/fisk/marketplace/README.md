# marketplace.tf PHP bindings

Based heavily on da-mitchell's Steam API bindings because the command pattern
 approach is great for this sort of thing.
 
 Yeah I feel kinda lame for copying most of it. But I really liked how it was
  structured. Hopefully I can diverge 
 it in
  the future if I can figure out a nice way to wrap response values for runners 
  instead of using a mixed type.
  
This wrapper does not currently include Partner APIs.

TODO: Runner tests.

## Composer

```
composer require fisk/marketplace
```

## Usage

```
<?php
$config = new Configuration([
    Configuration::API_KEY => ''
]);

$client = new Marketplace($config);
$client->addRunner(new GuzzleRunner(new Client(), new GuzzleUrlBuilder()));
$client->addRunner(new DecodeJsonStringRunner());

$result = $client->run(new GetDashboardItems());

print_r($result);
?>
```
